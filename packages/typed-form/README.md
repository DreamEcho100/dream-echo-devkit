## TODO

- [] On <packages/typed-form/src/Example.tsx:43> abstract the `try/catch` on the `onChange` to a reusable function.
- [] Adding a debounce feature for the fields values.
- [] Adding the option to an all fields value validation on submit and if not it will validate with fields an validation if exist, _(Adding the option to do both)_.
- [] Adding the feature to have uncontrolled fields and validate them on submit, _(Throwing an error if the validation doesn't exist?)_.
- [] Research and look if there any other helper methods to build for the form/input handling.
